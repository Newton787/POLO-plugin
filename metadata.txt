about=The POLO plugin, inspired by the messenger of the god Tup√£, facilitates access to information on heat spots in the state of Amazonas. Integrated with QGIS, it automatically generates reports and maps using data from NASA's FIRMS and INPE. The plugin quantifies and locates heat spots in real-time and the past seven days, identifying priority areas by municipality and mesoregion. Designed for ease of use, it allows offline navigation with GeoPDFs on the Avenza Maps app for example.
